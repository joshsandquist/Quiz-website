Module 4 Quiz Application

## Installation

None

## Usage
This website used many different aspects of HTML, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation in order to create a quiz website.
There was also local storage used to update and display a users high scores. 
This project took many attempts to get all parts working, and I would like to find a way to make the code more efficient.
